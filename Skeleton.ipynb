They offer products and services that are environmentally friendly and sustainable, in line with their values and ideals. They would like to determine how people perceive climate change and whether or not they believe it is a real threat. This would add to their market research efforts in gauging how their product/service may be received.\n","\n","With this context, the challenge is to create a Machine Learning model that is able to classify whether or not a person believes in climate change, based on their novel tweet data.\n","\n","Providing an accurate and robust solution to this task gives companies access to a broad base of consumer sentiment, spanning multiple demographic and geographic categories - thus increasing their insights and informing future marketing strategies.\n","\n","***Problem Statement ***: To determine how the people perceive climate change based on their novel tweets.\n","\n","**Solution**: Create a Machine Learning model that is able to classify whether or not a person believes in climate change, based on their novel tweet data.\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"824c23b1","metadata":{"id":"824c23b1"},"source":["<a id=\"cont\"></a>\n","\n","## Table of Contents\n","\n","<a href=#one>1.
